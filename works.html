                    Zesty AI
                    AI-Powered Lemonade.
                    This is an interactive AI installation to see how good AI is at making lemonade. We asked our audiences to engage with Zesty, our lemonade-based AI, by creating their own lemons out of arts and crafts materials and assorted non-lemon fruits and veg. Lemons scored points for not getting kicked out of the bowl by Zesty, and the highest scoring lemons were deemed lemonade worthy and juiced into the jug, whether it seemed to be a good idea or not...

                    CurfewVR
                    This is an empathy training tool that uses VR to explore the fem experience of public spaces at night. Using a mix of 360 captured video and Unity interactivity, users are taken on a journey through Birmingham at night, narrated by the verbatim voices of 16-86 year olds from the local community. The project aims to encourage victim-centered approaches to VAWG reduction, and is now implemented as training for the West Midlands Combined Authority.
