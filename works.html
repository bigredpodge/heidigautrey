                    This is an empathy training tool that uses VR to explore the fem experience of public spaces at night. Using a mix of 360 captured video and Unity interactivity, users are taken on a journey through Birmingham at night, narrated by the verbatim voices of 16-86 year olds from the local community. The project aims to encourage victim-centered approaches to VAWG reduction, and is now implemented as training for the West Midlands Combined Authority.
