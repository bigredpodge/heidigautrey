                        I recently built this website from scratch! I wanted to teach myself CSS so that I could create a simple, static website that best represented my work and practice. In particular, I was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://harriethw.com/">Harriet Horobin-Worley</a>, who gave a talk I attended with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.machine-streams.com/">machine streams</a> about <a target="_blank" href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-low-tech-website/">low-tech principles</a>. Most modern websites are personalized (even if we don't notice it) using cookies that track and research your digital footprint. This process involves pushing your data through multiple databases that takes time and power unnecesarily. My website has no need for cookies or your data - it is a static webpage and therefore loads much faster, doesn't process any user data, and crucially minimises energy usage. Furthermore, you may notice that the images on my site look unusual - this is because I have <a href="https://ditherit.com">dithered</a> them, a process that reduces the filesize of images dramatically.
                        <br><br>
                        I'm very pleased with this experiment into webdesign, that has allowed me to demonstrate my portfolio in a way that aligns with my creative and ethical principles, and I'm proud of how much code I managed to learn over half a week!

                        My current gamedev project, that I'm building in Unity! A creature collector game that uses turn based combat and rogue-like progression mechanics.
                        <br><br>
                        I'm developing this to practice my skills in C# and Unity, building a larger game with the capacity to essentially continue endlessly. With plans to collaborate with other creators, I am designing the game with a devilish aesthetic and theme in mind, in line with other indie titles like Hades and Cult of the Lamb. Currently, players are able to capture wild demons on their journey through the underworld, and use them to fight other demons and summoners! The demons have a variety of moves with different effects and powers that intend to match up in rock-paper-scissors fashion with their different elemental properties. 
                        <br><br>
                        I've just started on this project and I'm really excited to keep going with it!

                        A transmedia XR project for a wild and generous brief from the Watershed.
                        <br><br>
                        This was a research project to investigate how XR can cultivate new imaginations of community and form solidarity against the climate crisis. Messages in Bottles is a transmedia project involving a non-linear audio narrative of interconnected 'messages in bottles' received daily over a month. Alongside the audio experience, we prototyped an arduino controlled water tank, containing a sand-blasted metal structure that would rust in a curated, beautiful pattern of decay.
                        <br><br>
                        Concluding the experience, participants will be able to create their own message in a bottle, through an AR app. Using Google's Geospatial API, the words participants write will be augmented against the physical world around them. My role in this project involved collaborating and iterating on the creative vision held by the team and programming in Unity, C# and with arduinos used within the experience.

                        An experiment in 360 psychological horror.
                        <br><br>
                        In this 360 filmed horror narrative, the audience inhabits the remaining eyeball of a serial killer's latest victim. The killer takes you, the eyeball, on a journey through their favourite places, the view from the hill where you were murdered, to their fridge.
                        <br><br>
                        This project was my first foray into 360 video, so I aimed to use this project to push myself to experiment with the form. In particular, I found ways to manipulate the audience's perspective on the narrative by layering and blurring footage in 360, and in using ambisonic cues to draw their gaze. While the audience's expected gaze was drawn by actors or audio, I played with layering footage in the opposite direction, such that when they turned back the environment had changed, drawing on a sense of uncanny horror. During certain moments, I also chose to include moments of jumpscare only if an audience member looked in a place I didn't intend them to.
                        <br><br>
                        I didn't complete this project but I keep thinking about how I might properly craft a story around it to play with these ideas. It keeps calling back to me to return to it...

                        A more personal experiment, every year I create a series of tasks for my friends to carry out on camera, in the vein of Alex Horne's <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/taskmaster" target="_blank">Taskmaster</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        The tasks are always performed in groups, and I take a lot of joy in crafting puzzles and games for them to put their own spin on. In past years, I've got them to create flags out of food while blindfolded, transport flour across a park, and come up with a minute-long film in half an hour.
                        <br><br>
                        Building my own taskmaster every year lets me flex my game-building and video editing skills, to practice these muscles while making something to bring my friends a lot of fun.

                        After waking up from a raging house party, you find yourself alone in the back of a truly messed up garden. But as you start cleaning up, you also uncover darker secrets of the house and its watchful neighbour.
                        <br><br>
                        A Unity project to push my skills in working with C# in 3D. Players can wander the backyard, interact with the neighbour, and start cleaning up the mess outside. I had planned that the game would continue into a stealth horror genre as you explored the house, but was content with what I created and the skills I had learned.
